# remote_extract

this is a tiny tool to extract a file from a remote ZIP archive without downloading the entire thing.
it works via HTTP/1.1 Range headers, using the [Mordor](https://github.com/ccutrer/mordor) library.

it's kind of a proof-of-concept at present, but it's interesting enough to keep around
